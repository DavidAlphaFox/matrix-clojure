# mxWeb

The [Matrix](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/master/cljs/matrix) dataflow library applied to the Web. 

Yes, MatrixRN is under construction.

### Overview

Optimally efficient, truly reactive DOM programming in CLJS, without React, without _virtual dom_.

### How it works

Matrix-powered CLJS typed maps are arranged in a tree corresponding to a Web page DOM tree. Each Matrix node will transparently become a DOM node, long-lived across many renderings, coming and going only as the display responds to user interaction. 

DOM maintenance happens only when necessary; if an application state change requires only that some text turn red, the only DOM work will be to change the span's style attribute. Internally, the "red" decision will be made by the formula (function) for the span object style property. mxWeb includes an observer for such properties that applies them to the DOM node corresponding to the Matrix span map.

### Working Examples

[rxTrak](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/master/cljs/rxtrak) takes [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) to a new level by incorporating an AJAX lookup of each "to-do", now rX prescription, on the [FDA Drug database](https://open.fda.gov/apis/) looking adverse events with that drug. 

[rxTrak](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/master/cljs/rxtrak) demonstrates the grace with which Matrix handles async as does the [Matrix Flux Challenge](https://github.com/kennytilton/matrix/tree/master/cljs/fluxchallenge) implementation. The [Flux Challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge) originated from author Staltz's concern: "It's my personal belief that Flux does not provide an elegant way of coordinating multiple async data sources...".
